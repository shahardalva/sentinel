# Development notes

Newest entries first. Short: what was done, what was decided, what's next.

## 2026-10-23

### Done
- Repo made public. README with architecture diagram.
- CI on every PR: gofmt, go vet, go test -race.
- Load test with k6 against a mock upstream (100 ms delay). Median gateway
  overhead about 1 ms or less up to 1000 req/s. Results in bench/RESULTS.md.
- Concurrency cap made configurable (SENTINEL_MAX_CONCURRENT). ADR 0001.
- Private CA support for the upstream (SENTINEL_UPSTREAM_CA_FILE) and
  cmd/devcerts, so the mock runs over HTTPS. The https-only rule is unchanged.
- Docker Compose dev environment and Makefile. make bench-gateway runs only
  against a gateway fixed to the mock and refuses to start otherwise.

### Decided
- Tail spikes in the load test point at the shared test machine; treat p99
  as an upper bound until k6 runs on a separate machine.
- Mock over HTTPS with a private CA, instead of a flag that allows plain http.
- Merge dev into main with a merge commit, never squash. An earlier squash
  split the histories; fixed with a merge -s ours on dev.

### Learned
- Changes to .env need make up again; compose reads it only at start.
- The bench target could have hit the real API with the real key. Guard
  added, and auto-reload stays off on the Anthropic account.

### Next
- Per-key rate limits in Redis (token bucket, 429 with Retry-After).
- OpenAI provider behind the same interface.

## 2026-10-08

### Done
- Minimal Anthropic proxy in Go, stdlib only, behind a Provider interface.
- Gateway auth, streaming with per-chunk flush, first-byte and idle timeouts,
  header allowlist, resource limits, structured logs with per-stage timings.
- Two rounds of review with a reviewer agent; deferred findings filed as issues.

### Decided
- Gateway binds to 127.0.0.1 by default.
- Running streams are drained on shutdown up to the grace period.
